    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles, plus extra in case of breakage</li>
        <li>2.5 cups mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375°.</li>
        <li>Begin boiling a large pot of salted pasta water for the 
            lasagna noodles. Once a rapid boil is reached, cook the noodles 
            to al dente according to package instructions. (Set a timer to
             ensure you don’t overcook them.) Gently stir with a wooden spoon 
             throughout cooking to prevent the noodles from sticking. Drain 
             and rinse with cold water until noodles are completely cool
        </li>
        <li>
            Lay the cooled noodles flat on wax or parchment paper while you 
            begin assembling the lasagna.
